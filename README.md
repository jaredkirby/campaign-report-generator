- Maintains historical versions of campaign data
- Generates both Markdown reports and email-friendly formats
- Shows budget allocations at campaign, retailer, and monthly levels
- Includes campaign status checklists for setup tracking
- Automated email distribution of reports
- Automatic cleanup of old report files

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- pyyaml
- python-dotenv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaredkirby/campaign-report-generator.git
cd campaign-report-generator
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas pyyaml python-dotenv
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration
Create a `config.yaml` file in the project directory:

```yaml
input_offsite_csv: "path/to/your/input.csv"
output_dir: "path/to/output/directory"
```

### Email Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your email settings:

```env
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.office365.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD=your-password
EMAIL_PRIMARY_RECIPIENTS=recipient1@example.com,recipient2@example.com
EMAIL_CC_RECIPIENTS=cc1@example.com,cc2@example.com
```

Create **`reports`** and **`output`** directories in the project directory to store the input files and generated outputs, respectively.

## Input File Format

The tool expects a CSV file with the following columns:

- Tactic Start Date
- Tactic End Date
- Tactic Vendor
- Retailer
- Tactic Brand
- Event Name
- Tactic Name
- Tactic Product
- Tactic Order ID
- Tactic Allocated Budget

> **Note**: Use the Report Engine in Shopperations to generate a properly formatted CSV file.

Example CSV format:
```csv
"Tactic Start Date","Tactic End Date","Retailer","Tactic Brand","Event Name","Tactic Name","Tactic Vendor","Tactic Product","Budget Type","Tactic Order ID","Tactic Allocated Budget"
"2024-01-01","2024-01-31","ExampleRetailer","BrandName","EventName","CampaignType","VendorName","ProductName","Working","12345-01","50000"
```

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python campaign_report.py --config config.yaml
```

The tool will:
1. Read the input CSV file
2. Compare with previous report data (if any)
3. Generate both Markdown and email-friendly reports
4. Save a versioned copy of the campaign data for future change tracking
5. Send email reports if configured
6. Clean up old report files (configurable retention period)

## Output

The tool generates three types of files:

1. Campaign Status Report (`Campaign_Status_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`):
   - Summary of all campaigns
   - Budget totals
   - Campaign details grouped by status and retailer
   - Monthly organization for upcoming campaigns
   - Change indicators for modified campaigns

2. Email Report (`Campaign_Status_Email_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`):
   - Email-friendly text format of the campaign status
   - Same organization as the Markdown report
   - Optimized for email reading

3. Historical Data (`campaign_history/campaign_history_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`):
   - Versioned snapshots of campaign data
   - Used for change tracking between reports

### Change Indicators

The report uses the following indicators:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Campaign has changes
- üÜï New campaign
- üîÑ Number of changes in section

## Report Sections

Each report includes:
1. Summary statistics
2. Currently Active Campaigns (grouped by retailer)
3. Upcoming Campaigns (grouped by month, then retailer)
4. Completed Campaigns (grouped by retailer)

Each campaign entry shows:
- Event details
- Product information
- Budget allocation
- Date range
- Vendor information
- Setup status checklist
- Change history (if applicable)

## Email Distribution

When email configuration is present, the tool will:
- Send reports to specified primary recipients
- CC additional stakeholders as configured
- Include the report content in the email body
- Attach the Markdown version for reference
- Use a standardized subject line with the report date

## Report Cleanup

The tool automatically manages report history:
- Keeps reports for a configurable number of days (default: 30)
- Automatically removes older report files
- Maintains a clean output directory
- Preserves historical data for change tracking

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
1. Missing columns in input CSV:
   - Ensure all required columns are present
   - Check column names match exactly

2. Date format issues:
   - Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Remove any summary or total rows

3. Budget format issues:
   - Budget values should be numbers
   - Remove any currency symbols or commas

4. Email configuration issues:
   - Verify SMTP settings
   - Check email credentials
   - Ensure recipient addresses are valid
   - Check firewall/security settings
